# Fission
Fission is a physics engine I'm developing as a hobby project. My main goal with is to learn more about game physics, and I'm currently reading the [Game Physics in One Weekend](https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/) book series to gain a better understanding of the basics, although I tend to do a lot of research outside of the books.

If you want to give it a go I recommend using [premake](https://premake.github.io/) to generate the project files, since Fission uses premake by default.
